"""The backends module contains all solvers for the unit commitment problem. They all
share the base class BackendBase with similar solvers grouped in their own file. Currently
these categories are: SQA-based solvers, MILP-based solvers, D-Wave solvers and QAOA vis
IBM's qiskit runtime.

In conjuction with the backends, this module also contains a class for reading the input
and transforming it to call the solver correctly. Finallz, for any solvers that requires a quadratic
unconstrained binary optimization formulation, this module provides the IsingBackbone class
which serves as a layer of abstraction between the qubits and the network components. It works
in conjuction with the IsingSubproblem classes, which can be used to encode the problem in QUBO form.
These two classes are setup in a way, that the supported problems and constraints can easily extended
by making a new IsingSubproblem class (for new constraints) or extending the IsingBackbone (for 
being able to represent networks better).
